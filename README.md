## End Note
 
This is a individual project I tried to make the clone of the OverStock wesite as close to real one by using all the technical skills that we have learned up until now. We tried making it using React, Redux,  Mongodb ,  Node.js , Styled COmponent , Javascripts. We have also created the backend part of this website which is use for authentication as well as storing & filtering data products  .  Workflow is not the same as original. I tried my best to clone it.


## Limitations
 
Due to time constraints I am not able to spend time on media quries . Some pages are not excatly same as original website.
